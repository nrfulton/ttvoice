# ttvoice

Produces information about PGH's realtime bus schedule that can be sent to a voice synthesizer.

My use case: runs every couple of minutes in the morning when I'm getting close to leaving. I pipe the output to festival.

See http://nfulton.org/software/truetime.html for more information.
